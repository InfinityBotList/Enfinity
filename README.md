## About
This is a simple discord bot made using `PostgreSQL and discord.js (v14)` which allows us to handle
user and staff member based moderation at staff and management levels (ie this bot handles staff punishments too)
it also allows us to send helpful messages such as facts, support articles and more.

## Self Hosting
Self-Hosting is not supported or recommended as this bot is based heavily around our services and would require
a lot of user modification. However you are free to contribute.

---

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this source code and help us maintain the bot we 100% support that and that is the main reason why it is
open-source however we have a few things you should keep in mind before you make any changes:

- Commitlint is enforced and will run and check any and all of your commit messages for errors.
- Eslint and prettier are also enforced and will run prior to allowing you to commit or push the code.

### About these services
- Eslint: enforces a certain standard for your code
- Prettier: ensures proper formatting indenting etc
- Commitlint: ensures you follow our standards when using commit messages
